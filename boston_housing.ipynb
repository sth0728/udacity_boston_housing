In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

This implies that parents should prefer lower `'PTRATIO'` such that effectiveness of education is greater; therefore, the increase in the ratio should decrease the price. "

    "Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model.\n",
    "* The model with the max_depth of 3 performed the best as the training and the test scores converged.\n",
    "* The model with the max_depth of 1 was under-fitted. We can tell this by seeing both testing and training scores being low. \n",
    "* The mdoels with the max_depth of 6 and 10 were over-fitted. We can tell this by having high training score but low testing score.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve?\n",
    "* More training points decreases the training score because it is harder to generalize the model with more data points.\n",
    "* More training points increases the testing score because the model can generalize better with more training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would having more training points benefit the model?\n",
    "* Having many training points benefit the model but only up to a certain limit. Taking a look at the model with max_depth of 3, both training and testing scores stay relatively the same after 300 training points. This is because the model was generalized at 300 training points and the addtional training points do not help as they fit pretty well in the generalized model."

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",

    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "* We will first look at the validation score. The maximum depth of 3 and 4 both have good validation scores. However, the difference between training and validation scores are greater with the maximum depth of 4. This indicates that the model with a maximum depth of 4 overfited the training data more than the model with a maximum depth of 3. Therefore, the model with maximum depth of 3 best generalized the unseen data."

    "\n",
    "What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique?\n",
    "* In the term k-fold cross-validation, `'k'` represents the number of groups that a given sample is to be split into. If the group number is 5, then the technique is called 5-fold cross validation.\n",
    "* The process invovles splitting the test set into `'k'` number of buckets. For each bucket, use other buckets to train the model and evaludate the model by the current bucket. Once we have evaludation scores from all the buckets, the technique averages the evaluation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?\n",
    "* There are two benefits of using the k-fold cross validation:\n",
    " * The technique ensures to use all training set. In reality, the number of data points are finite so a model need to use as much data points as possible to be trained. By using k-fold cross valiadtion, it ensures that we use all training data points to evaluate a model.\n",
    " * The technique prevents over-fitting a model. It is possible that the training data points leak into the model such that the model does not generalize on the testing data point. By using different group as a training set, the evaludation metrics will report on generalization performance."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
